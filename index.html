    <!-- Cute love letter -->
    <div class="love-letter" id="love-letter">
        Aida, my dear girlfriend,
        <br><br>
        I am so truly lucky to have found you. You are such a beautiful and pretty girl. 
        You make me feel loved, safe, appreciated, and confident. It's so much more than happiness, 
        I am genuinely lucky to be loved by you. Even when I am insecure or need reassurance, you manage to make me feel better, 
        no matter what you feel. I need you in my life. You make me a better man and you are my other half. 
        I hope you never forget my love for you. I will make all my promises true one day. If you let me, I'll be yours until I die.
        Just look at you. Despite everything you have suffered, here you are... a strong, kind, and a resilient human being. 
        Somehow you still have that spark of optimism, even on those painful dark days, where healing feels impossible. 
        You still continue to believe in yourself even if it feels as if no one else does. 
        Even with tears in your eyes, you still face the world every single day, with a refusal to give up with everything life throws at you. 
        Just look at you, you are incredible you should be proud of yourself. I'm proud of you. I know the last time we talked was not ideal.
        I hope you are reading this with less stress and a better mood. If not, I hope this will make you feel better, and something you can look
        back on whenever you need a mood life. So it's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be really hard. We're gonna have to work at this everyday, 
        but I wanna do that because I want you. I want all of you. Forever you and me, everyday. 
        I love you firstly because I can be myself around you, you make me feel safe to "come out of my shell" 
        if that makes sense which is really hard for me because I don't like showing my genuine emotions. Everytime you listen to my stupid problems,
        you always listen and never get annoyed. How can I not love you? Everyday I wonder how someone like me has you as my love. You always say
        that you don't deserve me, but the truth is that, I don't deserve you. You are a star in the night sky, always brings light to the dark.
        I hope for many more days, weeks, months, and years. I hope one day you get to be Khadija Khan (only if you want lol), 
        and we can go to Japan together. I love you forever.
        <br><br>
        I love you forever, your handsome boy <3
